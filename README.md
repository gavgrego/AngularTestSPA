AngularTestSPA - Gavin Gregory
==============
My initial testing grounds/sandbox for a future, in-progress, AngularJS single-page application.

- I'm using the [Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman "Yeoman") workflow for scaffolding, dependency management, and testing.
- Bootstrap 3 as well, although I may wind up trying HTML5 Boilerplate for the hell of it.
